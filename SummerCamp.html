    <h2>What Do We Do?</h2>
    <p1>Highschool students from district 204 coach middle schoolers who want to see what robotics is like. This two week camp will provide middle school students with a chance to play the brand new game for the 2020-2021 Vex Robotics season. We split the kids in the camp into teams of 5-6 each. They will have two weeks to build a robot with the guidance of 2-3 student coaches working with their team. The kids get 5 days to build, 2 days to program, 1 day to test, and 2 days to compete with the other teams at the camp. The winning team all got a free Raspberry Pi.
    The camp runs from Monday June 15th to Friday June 26th from 1:30 P.M. to 5:30 P.M. at Metea Valley High School in Room C-124.
