        The Engineering Process
      </h2>

      <p1>
        Here at Metea Valley Robotics, we strive to build the best robots we can. In order to build a good robot, there are certain steps a team should take. These steps are known as the Engineering Process. Below are the steps a team should follow in order to suceed in building a robot:
      </p1>

      <ul>
        <li>
          Define the problem
        </li>

        <p>
          Vex Robotics each year provides a detailed description and explaination of that year's competition. In short, they are describing a <b>problem</b> that needs to be solved. There, you already know what you are solving for!
        </p>

        <li>
          Research the Problem
        </li>

        <p>
          So you know the problem. Now what? A team should look into what the competition is and what type of robot they may need/use.
        </p>

        <li>
          Requirements
        </li>

        <p>
          Typically, a team must follow certain rules when building a robot or playing it on the field. A team should always look into these guidlines beforehand so they don't skip over essential details. Another requirement which a team should identify is what they actually need to build the robot. Parts? A laptop?
        </p>

        <li>
          Brainstorm Solutions and Ideas
        </li>

        <p>
          This one is quite self-explainatory. A team should come up with ideas on what the robot will look like and how it will function. Brainstorm and share any ideas that come to mind and write them down (For this, you should definetly use your engineering notebook). Once you develop that idea, start sketching out different parts of the robot.
        </p>

        <li>
          Build Your First Robot
        </li>

        <p>
          Start building the "prototype" of your robot using the ideas and designs and ideas you put down.
        </p>

        <li>
          Test
        </li>

        <p>
          During the testing phase, a team should make sure all components of the robot work as intented (without breaking) and debug the robot.
        </p>

        <li>
          Final Step: Did it work?
        </li>

        <p>
          Typically, no robot is perfect on the first try. You are bound to fail at some point and many times a lot. If the robot worked, great! Think of ways to improve what you already have done. If it didn't work as intended, revise! You may have to go back to the drawing board if things go really wrong with the robot.
        </p>
      </ul>

        Code Structure
      </h2>

      <p1>
        The structure of our code is important when programming a robot. Laying out the code helps to look at the general idea of all the robot's inner functions and expand on them. Before getting into the programming of the robot, a team must first decide on what program they will use. There are several different IDE's for Vex Robotics, but two of the more significant ones include VexCode and Vex Pros. They are both great code IDE's and each have their own pros and cons. After deciding on the program, we must then familiarize ourselves with it and begin programming shortly after. The programming stage of robotics is key to creating a good robot. You must have code that is both organized/easy to navigate and effective. The use of variables will greatly help in keeping the code clean and less complicated while minimizing room for error. [TBD]

        Understandably, many struggle in their early years of robotics, and it can be quite difficult to keep up with the competition. There are a few ways you can get help.
