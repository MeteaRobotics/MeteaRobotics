        What do We do?
      </h2>

      <p1>
        Here at Metea Valley Robotics' Summer Camp, middle-schoolers in District 204 interested in the world of robotics are given the remarkable opportunity to learn and
        experience their passion for robotics up close with our high-schoolers. This two week camp provides middle school students with a chance to play the brand new game
        for the 2020-2021 Vex Robotics season. The students, split into teams of 5-6, are given a two-week period to build a robot with the guidance of 2-3 high-school
        student coaches working with their team. The students are given 5 days to build, 2 days to program, 1 day to test, and 2 days to compete with the other teams at the
        camp. The winning team can expect to win prizes, such as a Raspberry Pi. The Summer Camp runs from Monday, June 15th, to Friday, June 26th, from 1:30 P.M. to 5:30 P.M.
        at Metea Valley High School in Room C-124.

        Towards the end of the Summer Camp, the tournament has dwindled down to two teams, who will face off in a final match. This match is live streamed to YouTube, so those
        who were not able to attend the Summer Camp and wish to watch what our students have created over the two weeks they worked can do so. The link is provided below.
